# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - Power BI

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.  

As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate **“Business and Data Intelligence”** to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.  

Their revenue management team decided to hire a **third-party service provider** to extract insights from their historical data.  

## Task List  

You are a **data analyst** who has been provided with **sample data** and a **mock-up dashboard** to work on the following tasks. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.  

1. **Create the metrics** according to the metric list.  
2. **Build a dashboard** according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.  
3. **Generate additional insights** that are not included in the metric list or mock-up dashboard.

## Key Learnings from this Project  

- By researching different **cancellation policies** followed by hotels, I found that most hotels charge **zero fees** only if the booking is canceled **at least three months before** the booking date. If canceled later, charges range from **60% to 90%** of the booking cost.  
- Learned how to use **bookmarks and selection** for different purposes, such as **page navigation** and **clear filter buttons** in the dashboard.  
- Applied a **consistent color palette** throughout the dashboard to maintain a professional design.
